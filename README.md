# Space Invaders in Lua

This is a lua implementation of the famous Space Invaders. I have tried to keep it as close as possible to the original game, have tried to create
similar looking sprites, similar color schemes, and same type of movement. Bonus redship is also available, yaay!.

## How to run

This project uses love2d which is a very popular game framework in Lua. You will need to have love2d on your system. You can follow love2d's
official documentation to get it on your system. Once done, you can follow the below steps:

- Open this repository in terminal

- Execute ```love ./```

- Love2d window with the game running in it should open.
